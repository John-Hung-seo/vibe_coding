# VIVE Blog Converter v1.3

This repository contains a simple HTML page for converting blog content to a VIVERSE-friendly format.

Open `index.html` in your browser. Paste your original HTML content in the first editor and click **Convert to VIVERSE**. Use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the converted HTML.

The converter embeds remote images as data URIs and keeps line breaks intact.
Version 1.3 improves clipboard compatibility with the browser's copy
command and auto-scrolls the debug panel when new messages appear.
