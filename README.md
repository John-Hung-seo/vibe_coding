# VIVE Blog Converter v1.5


This repository contains a simple HTML page for converting blog content to a VIVERSE-friendly format.

Open `index.html` in your browser. Paste your original HTML content in the first editor and click **Convert to VIVERSE**. Use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the converted HTML.

The converter embeds remote images as data URIs and keeps line breaks intact.

Version 1.5 fixes a JavaScript syntax error on some browsers and provides a
fallback clipboard method so copied content works more reliably.
